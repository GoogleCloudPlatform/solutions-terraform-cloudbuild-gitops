# Managing infrastructure as code with Terraform, Cloud Build, and GitOps

This is the repo for the [Managing infrastructure as code with Terraform, Cloud Build, and GitOps](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/managing-infrastructure-as-code) tutorial. This tutorial explains how to manage infrastructure as code with Terraform and Cloud Build using the popular GitOps methodology. 

## Configuring your **dev** environment

Just for demostration, this step will:
 1. Configure an apache2 http server on network '**dev**' and subnet '**dev**-subnet-01'
 2. Open port 80 on firewall for this http server 

```bash
cd ../environments/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## Promoting your environment to **production**

Once you have tested your app (in this example an apache2 http server), you can promote your configuration to prodution. This step will:
 1. Configure an apache2 http server on network '**prod**' and subnet '**prod**-subnet-01'
 2. Open port 80 on firewall for this http server 

```bash
cd ../prod
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```
