# Machine learning platform experiment

Investigations into managing vertex.ai with terraform to get a proper CI/CD workflow and make suitable abstractions for easy developer experience.

Goals:
- A personal workbench with jupyter labs and flexible hardware/framework/versions for model development
- Scheduled pipelines for periodically training (and versionning) machine learning models
- Hosting models with cloud run to make experimentation cheaper

All done "automagically" according to our chosen development flow
